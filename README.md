# TickTock App

This is a little stop watch app that we create with a boy on his BoysDay in our company.
He visit the 5th grade and had one day to find out what people in a digital agency do.

We planned this little stop watch app, created an icon and implement all things of course.
So he left the office with his own stop watch app o his phone.

## Disclamer

This app is also a little insight in the react native development.
Nothing fancy here with redux or mobx for the states, but everything works out of the box ;)
